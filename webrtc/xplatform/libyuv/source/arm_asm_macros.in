  MACRO
  MEMACCESS $base
	; Alternative of MEMACCESS macro defined in row.h. 
	; Currently assembler source files are used only for Windows Phone (MS armasm compiler),
	; so this macro is empty. It is defined for code compatibility.
	; Eventually asm. source files should be used for all platforms, so some platforms might require 
	; some implementation. See row.h (define MEMACCESS) for details.
