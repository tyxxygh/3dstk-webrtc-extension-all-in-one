Description: library interface to the XKB compiler - development files
 xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including loading them
 from disk, parsing them and handling their state. It's mainly meant for client
 toolkits, window systems, and other system applications; currently that
 includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Clutter, and more.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxkbcommon0. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
