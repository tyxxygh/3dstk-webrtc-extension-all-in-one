Communication Control
-----------------------

The Communication Control is a layout-only control that can be used to easily setup a user interface for application supporting IM, audio calls and video calls.
The control allows the developer to easily add a list of conversations and have the interface react to the state of the conversations.


--- Developer Information ---
The Communication Control is a layout only control that renders a list of conversations and adjust the UI according the the state of each item.
Due to the RelativeSource limitation (listed below), the control requires a set of interfaces to allow proper bindings, namely IConversation and IInstantMessage.
RelativeSource limitation:
RelativeSource FindAncestor is not available, making the posibility of a binding from an inner control to the parent control's dependency properties impossible.
Due to this limitation, in order to effectively bind the UI commands and states to each item, an interface has to be used.



--- Using the control ---
An instance of the control can be defined in XAML and then customized via the dependency properties it exposes.
Example:

<controls:CommunicationControl Conversations="{Binding Conversations}"
                               SelectedConversation="{Binding SelectedConversation, Mode=TwoWay}"
                               ContactListHeaderTemplate="{StaticResource ContactListHeaderTemplate}">
</controls:CommunicationControl>

Each item in the source of Conversations has to implement the IConversation interface.
In order to get updates in the UI via bindings, the item object should implement INotifyPropertyChanged interface as well.

For video rendering, the source item must set the "LocalVideoRenderer" and "RemoteVideoRenderer" properties with instances of controls that can be used to render a video stream (ex: MediaElement, SwapChainPanel, etc.).

The "CallState" property of the interface controls the state of the UI, defining which UI elements are visible at what time.
Example:
In Idle, the IM elements, audio call and video call controls are visible and enabled.
In Local and Remote ringing states, audio and video controls and local and remote video render controls are visible and enabled, while the IM interface is hidden and disabled.
