#
# 'language' entry specifies the "current language".
# The current language is used when the idnkit library performs
# language specific lowercase conversion and language-based local
# mapping (described later).
#
# The entry can be specified only once. If the entry is not specified,
# the library determines the current language from locale information.

# <language> must be an ISO639 language code. Both ISO639-1 (e.g. 'en'
# for English) and ISO639-2 (e.g. 'eng') codes are recognized.

#
# 'map' entry specifies mapping procedures.
# Unlike IDNA2003, IDNA2008 doesn't define explicit mapping procedures.
# The idnkit library performs mapping procedures according with the
# entry.
#
# syntax)
#       map             <procedure> ...
#
# The following procedures are currently available:
#
#       lowercase             Map uppercase letters to lowercase.
#       width                 Decompose full-width and half-width characters.
#       nfc                   Unicode Normalization Form C.
#       nfkc                  Unicode Normalization Form KC.
#       delimitermap          Map specific characters to '.' (U+002E).
#       language-local        Language based local mapping.
#       tld-local             TLD based local mapping.
#       tr46-map              UTS #46 non-transitional mapping.
#       tr46-map-deviation    UTS #46 transitional mapping.
#       tr46-check            UTS #46 non-transitional validataion.
#       tr46-check-deviation  UTS #46 transitional validataion.
#       rfc5895               Apply 'lowercase', 'width', 'nfc' and
#                             'delimitermap' in that order.
#	resman-idna2008-mappings-01
#	                      Same as 'rfc5895'.
#       tr46-processing       Apply 'tr46-map', 'nfc' and 'tr46-check'
#                             in that order.
#       tr46-processing-deviation
#                             Apply 'tr46-map-deviation', 'nfc' and
#                             'tr46-check-deviation' in that order.
#
# The procedures are executed in the order listed in the entry.
# The same procedure can be specified twice or more. Suppose that
# 'map nfc language-local nfc' is specified, idnkit does Unicode
# Normalization Form C, language based local mapping, and then 
# performs NFC again.
#
# The entry can be specified only once. If the entry is not specified,
# the library supposes that:
#
# 	rfc5895 language-local nfc
#
# is specified.
#
map	rfc5895 language-local nfc

#
# 'delimiters' specifies code points which should be mapped to '.'
# (U+002E; FULL STOP) at delimitermap.
#
# Note that the mapping is applied only when 'delimitermap' is
# specified in a 'map' entry.
#
# syntax)
#	delimiters	<code point> ...
#
# <code point> is a hexadecimal integer of Unicode code point of
# a delimiter (e.g. 3002), which can be preceded by "U+" (e.g. U+3002).
#
# The entry can be specified only once. If the entry is not specified,
# the library assumes "3002" is specified.
#
delimiters	3002

#
# 'language-local' entry specifies language based local mapping.
#
# Note that the mapping procedure is applied only when 'language-local'
# is specified in a 'map' entry.
# 
# syntax)
#       language-local <language> <map file>
#
# If the current language matches <language>, a mapping specified by
# <map file> is performed.  Otherwise no mapping is performed.
#
# <language> must be an ISO639 language code. Both ISO639-1 (e.g. 'en'
# for English) and ISO639-2 (e.g. 'eng') codes are recognized.
#
# A local mapping with '*' as <language> is a default mapping.
# When the current language is not matched to any <language>s of
# 'language-local' entries, the mapping is applied.
#
#language-local *	/some/where/default.map
#language-local tr	@pkgmapdir@/tr.map
language-local ja	@pkgmapdir@/ja.map

#
# 'tld-local' entry specifies TLD (top level domain) based local mapping.
#
# Note that the mapping is applied only when 'tld-local' is specified
# in a 'map' entry.
# 
# syntax)
#       tld-local <tld> <map file>
#
# If the TLD of the domain name matches <tld>, a mapping specified by
# <map file> is performed on the domain name. Otherwise no mapping
# is performed.
#
# If <tld> is '*', the mapping is applied to domain names whose TLD
# does not match any TLDs specified in 'tld-local' entries. If <tld> is 
# '-', the mapping is applied to domain names without any dots.
# 
# For backward compatibility to idnkit-1.0, the entry name 'local-map'
# can be used instead of 'tld-local'. The entry can be defined multiple
# times.
